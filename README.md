# Cyclistic_Bike_Analysis

## Project Overview
Analyzed Cyclistic bike trip data to compare annual members and casual riders and provide insights for marketing strategies to convert casual riders into members.

## Data
- trips.csv: Historical bike trip data

## Analysis
- Pivot tables and charts for trip duration, distance, and number of trips
- Insights about user behavior patterns

## Key Findings
- Members travel longer distances, spend less time per trip, and take more trips
- Casual riders spend more time per trip, mostly on weekends
- Both groups show increased activity on weekends
